# Changelog

All notable changes to `@brooswit/thatch`. Format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
entries are `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with subsections from: `BREAKING`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`.
CI refuses a merge that changes `src/`, `schema/` or `package.json` without a new entry here.

## Versioning — what the numbers mean in this project

- **MAJOR** — a restructuring or rewrite that breaks a lot of things, requiring reimplementation by consumers. Requires a `### BREAKING` section.
- **MINOR** — a new feature, or a change to an existing feature that breaks just that feature.
- **PATCH** — a fix or correction that requires no consumer code changes, or very minor ones.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-26
### Changed
- Repository moved to the brooswit-factory org; package.json repository/homepage/bugs URLs updated (npm provenance verifies repository.url against the building repo).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-24
### Removed
- The `send` event (`mcp.on("send", ...)`). A send is something you initiate and already get a `Delivery` back from synchronously, so the event was redundant to the caller; a central audit of sends is better done at your call sites or by wrapping `mcp.send`. `connect` and `disconnect` — which happen *to* you — remain.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-24
### Removed
- `connection.lastSeenAt` — convenience metadata nothing depended on; derive it from the `send` event if wanted.
- `connection.channelReady` (the public getter). Stream-attachment is still tracked internally — it is what keeps `C2` honest and lets `send` return `no-channel-stream` — but it is no longer exposed. Use the `send` result as the signal. (If the connect→send readiness race bites in practice, a `ready` event is the fix, not a pollable flag.)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-24
### Removed
- Per-connection send history (`connection.history`, the `history` option, `HistoryEntry`). The UUID redesign meant it no longer spanned a reconnect, which was its whole reason to exist; and the `send` event `(connection, frame, delivery)` lets an app build exactly the history it wants — keyed by a header so it *does* survive reconnect. The library version was strictly weaker, so it is gone.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-24
### Added
- `auth(req) => boolean | Promise<boolean>` option: a gate run when a client connects — return false to refuse it (401). Default accepts everyone. It is a gate, not identity: an accepted client still gets a UUID and holds its headers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-24
### Changed
- Connections are identified by a server-assigned **UUID**, not a caller-supplied name. `identify` and `onDuplicate` are removed; every client is accepted (reject unwanted ones with an Elysia route guard before the handler). A connection now **holds all its request headers** (`connection.headers`, including `authorization`/`cookie` — treat a connection list as sensitive), and you address/find connections by id or by a header predicate.
### Added
- `connection.send(frame)` and `connection.close()`.
- `connections.find(pred)` / `connections.filter(pred)`; `mcp.once(event)` (promise) and `mcp.off(event, fn)`.
- Send history and `disconnect` reasons are now keyed by connection id (history no longer spans a reconnect — a new connection is a new id).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-24
### Added
- `thatch()` — an Elysia plugin + handle for a central HTTP MCP server that many Claude Code sessions connect to by URL.
- Named connections: `identify()` names each connection; `connections.{list,get,has,count,waitFor}`; `onDuplicate: "replace" | "reject"`.
- A channel that pushes `<channel>` frames into a session, addressed by name: `send`, `sendMany`, `sendAll`.
- `Delivery` — a discriminated union, never `void`. `C2` is claimed only when a client's notification stream is actually attached; a registered connection with no stream refuses as `no-channel-stream` rather than a false success. Non-string meta refuses as `bad-meta` instead of being silently dropped.
- Per-name send history (survives reconnect), events (`connect`/`disconnect`/`send`), and `connection.channelReady`.
- `@brooswit/thatch/testing` — `FakeConnection`, a Claude-Code stand-in over real HTTP.
